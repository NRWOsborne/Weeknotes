## Shrewsbury team meeting ##
It was great to meet all of the Digital team for a face to face-to-face meeting on Monday. We discussed what’s gone well, challenges ahead and any new ideas going forward. As usual, the team had a lot to discuss and plan. We rewarded ourselves with an after meeting pizza.
